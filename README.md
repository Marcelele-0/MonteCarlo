# Monte Carlo Integration Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to approximate integrals using the Monte Carlo method. It includes Python code to perform simulations and generate visualizations of the results. The project is organized to facilitate easy configuration, environment setup, and execution of the simulations. 

## Requirements

- Conda package manager (e.g., via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))

## Installation

To set up the project environment and install all necessary dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:
   
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Marcelele-0/MonteCarlo 
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd MonteCarlo
    ```

3. Create and activate the Conda environment:
